# pxlsrt - Pixel Sorting Algorithm Implemented in Python w/ NumPy


## Notes
Pixel sorting is an image manipulation technique that arranges pixels based on their intensity or color values, creating abstract effects on images. This notebook guides you through the step-by-step process of reproducing this effect using [NumPy](https://numpy.org).

The code in this repository is based on or inspired by:
